        <p id="tribute-info">Chanakya was born in a very poor Brahmin family in around 350 BC at Takshashila.
            His father’s name was Chanak and his mother’s name was Chaneshvari.
            In his childhood days, Chanakya studied the whole Vedas and learned about politics.
            He had a wisdom tooth. There was a common belief at that time, that having a wisdom tooth is a sign of becoming the king.
            His mother was scared to hear an astrologer say “he will grow up to become a king and forget her after becoming king”.
            At that time Chanakya broke his wisdom teeth and promised his mother that “Mother, don’t worry. 
            I will take good care of you.”
            Before the rise of the Maurya Empire, North India was under the rule of Nandas. Due to the lack of proper administrations,
            the Kings of Nandas empire were exploiting the people.
            Chanakya played a major role in removing such robbers like Dhananand and establishing the Mauryan Empire. 
            Chanakya was born in 350 BC into a Brahmin family though the details of his birthplace are still unclear.
            According to Hemachandra, a Jain writer he was born to Chanin and his wife Chaneshvari in the Chanaka village of the Golla region 
            on the contrary there are other sources that claim the name of Chanakya’s father was Chanak. 
            He completed his education in Takshashila and grew up to be a well-read young man. 
            It is believed that along with his knowledge in subjects like political science, economics, war strategies, astrology, and medicine, he was also familiar with the elements of Persian and Greek learning.
            He had full knowledge of Vedas Literature as well.
            Marriage LifeAfter completing his education, Chanakya began to work as a teacher in nearby areas of  Takshashila, Nalanda.
            Acharya Chanakya’s Arthashastra deals with various subjects including welfare, fiscal and monetary policies, war strategies, and international relations.
            While the ‘Neeti Shastra’ is regarded as the collection of aphorisms that were collected by him from the existing shastras. Some of the famous life lessons that he gave:
            hanananda who was the emperor of Magadha at that time had organized a food meal for the Brahmins at Pushpapuri. Chanakya also attended the meal in the desire to receive 
            some gifts from King Dhanananda by giving suggestions about unbroken India. But Dhanananda was a very arrogant King and he insulted Chanakya by looking at his ugly appearance and directly rejected his suggestions. 
            Then Chanakya got very angry and vowed to destroy the Nanda Empire. Then Dhanananda ordered his people to arrest him. But Chanakya escaped from there in disguise. After escaping from the court of Dhanananda, Chanakya successfully hid and started living around Magadh. During this time he became friends with his rival Dhanananda’s son, Pabbata. Chanakya was able to conquer Pabbata’s mind and was able to obtain a royal ring and went to the forest. 
           Chanakya used his wisdom to earn 80 crores of golden coins from that royal ring. Keeping so many golden coins safe by digging a hole in the jungle, he went to look for a person who could successfully help him finish Dhananand. Chanakya was looking for someone who could destroy the Nanda dynasty of Dhanananda from the root. At the same time, Chandragupta was seen in the eyes of Chanakya. Chanakya then gave 1000 gold coins to his foster parents and took him with them to the forest. At present Chanakya was ready with two weapons to remove Dhanananda’s head. If Chandragupta was among them, the other was Pabbata. 
           Chanakya decided to train one among those two and make him the emperor. 
           decided to take a small test between them. In that test, Chandragupta successfully removed Pabbata’s head and became victorious.
